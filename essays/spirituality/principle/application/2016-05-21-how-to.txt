The principle of being is nonidentifying observation. To apply it is to observe without identifying, not even identifying to your mind. To apply it is to just be. The principle can only be lived, not understood. This article is not at all theoretical, but deeply practical. Apply it.
To be is usually done unconsciously, passively by people. The principle of being is applied when to be is done consciously, actively.
Consciousness is what you truly are. Consciousness is not mortal mind, but an ability to experience (to live), an ability to focus on aspects of what it experiences, and an ability to identify with what it focuses on.
